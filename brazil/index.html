                    The trip has been carefully designed for digital nomads and remote workers.
                </h3>
                It’s a perfect balance between communal activities and personal time,
                allowing for a slow-paced exploration of Brazil’s breathtaking coastline—home to some 
                of the best kitesurfing conditions in the world.
                <br><br>
                With steady winds blowing from morning to sunset at 20–35 knots and warm waters above 26°C,
                the conditions are ideal for all levels. Along the way, we’ll experience a mix of open ocean and flat-water lagoons, 
                remote hideaways, and vibrant social hubs. Over four weeks, we’ll stay in three different locations, explore many more, 
                and conclude our adventure in the legendary town of Jericoacoara.
                <br><br>
                Nomad Winds is more than just another kitesurfing trip—it’s a lifestyle.
                It’s designed for digital nomads and remote workers who want to combine work, adventure,
                and community but welcomes also all the longterm travellers.
                <br><br>
                This is an opportunity to meet your tribe, push your limits, and create lifelong connections.

                            One of the oldest and most famous spots, where most kitesurfers start their Brazilian adventure, and so are we.
                            Location close to the airport will allow some flexibility with arrival times.
                            Social vibe and lots of events willallow us to dive deep into Brazilian lifestyle straight from the beginning.
                            <br><br>
                            In Cumbuco, you can experience it all: flat-water lagoons just a short downwind or drive away,
                            choppy ocean conditions, and waves.

                            Very remote but also breathtaking with beauty. Bring your drone for the epic footage.
                            <br><br>
                            It features multiple flat-water lagoons nestled among mangroves at high tide,
                            flat river mouth at low tide and small waves on the ocean side.
                            It’s a perfect playground for progress and one of our favourite spots.

                            Probably the most iconic big-air spot in Brazil, Tatajuba is also the windiest location on the coast.
                            It offers a mix of butter-flat lagoons right in front of the house and some of the best right-side kickers
                            in the world in the open ocean. A short drive or downwinder away from other legendary spots,
                            it’s a true kitesurfing paradise.
                            <br><br>
                            This small town, nestled in the sand dunes, has no paved roads and is hard to access—but that’s part of its charm.
                            The small but strong community creates a unique atmosphere, and there’s always something going on.

                            In Cumbuco and Macapá, accommodation will be provided in carefully selected local houses with kitchens and common areas
                            suitable for working, all located a convenient distance from the beach.
                            In Tatajuba, due to limited options and the remote nature of the village,
                            we will stay in a pousada that includes breakfast and common areas, but no kitchen.
                            <br><br>
                            All properties have been vetted for internet quality, and we’ll also have our own Starlink as a backup.
                            Please note that power outages can occur in Brazil, though they are relatively rare.
                            <br><br>
                            The price includes accommodation in twin rooms. Private rooms are available for an additional cost of €800.

                            Once a week, we’ll gather to cook dinner together, make homemade caipirinhas, and hang out.
                            All ingredients for those meals will be provided. Our communal dinners are a fantastic opportunity to
                            get to know each other and connect.
                            <br><br>
                            Otherwise, food and drinks will be your expenses. Dinner prices range from 5€ at local eateries to 25€ at upscale,
                            tourist-oriented restaurants, with options in between.
                            For those on a budget, most of the accommodations include kitchen facilities so you can cook your own meals.

                            At all times, we will have a car available for the group to run errands, do shopping, or go to the ATM.
                            On transfer days, we will provide additional cars with drivers to transport everyone and all the equipment
                            between the spots.
                            <br><br>
                            We will also share contacts for affordable taxis, buggies, and other services to help avoid 'gringo prices'
                            when organizing additional trips or activities.

                            The airport transfers are not included but we can help you arrange the accredited transfer for Cumbuco (extra cost of 25€).
                            Uber is an option but officially they are not allowed to transport quivers so many drivers decline.

                    Nomad Winds was born from the desire to be surrounded with like-minded people even in remote locations,
                    and to foster a sense of community in a lifestyle that can sometimes feel isolating.
                    It delivers community-driven co-living and co-working expeditions.

                            An adventurer and digital nomad, she has been working remotely from windy places since 2021.
                            Apart from chasing the wind and aiming for the next WOO PR (13,9 m), Aleksandra sometimes works as a designer,
                            researcher and strategist.
